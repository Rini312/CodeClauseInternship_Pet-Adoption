                <p><i><b> Animals are capable of giving us a lifetime of unconditional love without expecting anything in return. This is especially true for the strays, abandoned, and rescued animals, who are desperately searching for the tiniest bit of compassion and kindness after all the suffering and hardships they’ve been through.</i></p></b>

                <h1>5 Reasons You Should Adopt From An Animal Shelter</h1>
              <u> <ul><li> <h3> Save an animal’s life : </h3> </li></ul></u>
                <p> For millions of shelter animals, getting adopted by someone is their only chance at life, which means that you are their best chance at experiencing happiness again.
These animals end up in shelters due to unfortunate circumstances. They are either stray animals, abandoned pets, or runaways pets that have been exposed to a lot of abuse, suffering, and pain. It doesn’t take much for these guys to be happy and content, all they need is someone to love and care for them. </p>
               <u><ul><li> <h3>Rescues make great first pets : </h3></li></ul></u>
                <p>Animals at the shelter would be a good choice for first-time pet owners. This is because these animals will already be partially house trained and accustomed to people at the shelter. By choosing to adopt an animal from the shelter, you will be saving them from fear, distress, and death. Moreover, a lot of shelter animals are obedient pets that had their comfort and happiness snached away after being abandoned by their owners. </p>
             <u> <ul><li><h3> Why pedigree pets from breeders & pet stores are a terrible choice : </h3></li></ul></u>
                <p>As we always say, Adopt, don’t shop! Unethical breeders and pet shops are a no-go as most breeding practices in India are extremely immoral and cruel. A lot of the ‘pedigree’ puppies and kittens you come across will be a result of mass breeding or backyard breeding. These animals are mercilessly abused and forced to reproduce by breeders who treat them and their litters as nothing more than tools to make money. </p>
                <u><ul><li><h3> Shelters help with the adoption process & guide you : </h3></li></ul></u>
                <p> Adopting from a shelter would be a great choice for anyone, especially If you are a first-time pet parent or have little experience with animals. This is because shelters will guide you through the process and will also provide you with all the information you need, making it easier for you to take care of your adopted pet.</p>
                <u><ul><li><h3> You will always be proud of having saved a life : </h3></li></ul></u>
                <p>The biggest incentive and reward you can get is the joy and happiness of having saved a life! There’s nothing in this world that can make you truly happier. It gives you a sense of delight and pride that can never be bought using money, and is the most wonderful feeling you will have all your life. </p>
